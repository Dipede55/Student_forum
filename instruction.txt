Grok file:

session_start.php is Check.php

Issues:
Images are not displayed on website:
- wrong path
- permission for both folder and image: cd to the folder's path 
- wrong variable:
- forget to select the image column in database
- write wrong name of image column in database: its "img" not "image"
- right: <input type="file" name="image" accept="image/*"> (addquestion.html.php)
     wrong because the accept you write is "images/*" but it is right without "s"
     the name in input field is "image" but in php file, it reading file "img" - it cannot found the image uploaded
  wrong: if (isset($_FILES['img']) && $_FILES['img']['error'] == 0) (addquestion.php)
- understand where is the root folder and how to write a right path of a file even it is in a deep level.
  Define the root folder first, incase the connection between many deep level files. 
  $basefolder = COMP1841/studentforum/ -> in use: <?= $basefolder ?> index.php
DatabaseFunctions:
- To display the total jokes: 1. add path of DatabaseFunctions to the questions.php file, 2. set variable call "totalquestion" a function which is totalquestion function.
WARNNING IN QUERY: 
forget to take "question.img" column -> cannot find the images and undefined path or the folder store images
- $sql = 'SELECT question.id, question.text, question.date, user.name, question.img FROM question

Git:
Usually command used: 
step by step: 
- cd to the paricular folder: if not may be the whole folder COMP1841 with n files will be pushed all. 
- git init, git add .: add all files to that empty repo 
- git remote add origin -link repo-: if there is no repo and the repo link must have .git
- git remote set-url origin -link repo-: if want to change repo
- git remote -v: check the present repo 
- git commit
- git push -u origin main: push to main branch 
DONE!!!

to update any change to github:
- git add file.name 
- git commit -m "something"
- git push (already in main branch)
