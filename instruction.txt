Issues:
Images are not displayed on website:
- wrong path
- permission for both folder and image: cd to the folder's path 
- wrong variable:
- forget to select the image column in database
- write wrong name of image column in database: its "img" not "image"
WARNNING IN QUERY: 
forget to take "question.img" column -> cannot find the images and undefined path or the folder store images
- $sql = 'SELECT question.id, question.text, question.date, user.name, question.img FROM question
