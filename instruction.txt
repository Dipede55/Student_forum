Issues:
Images are not displayed on website:
- wrong path
- permission for both folder and image: cd to the folder's path 
- wrong variable:
- forget to select the image column in database
- write wrong name of image column in database: its "img" not "image"
WARNNING IN QUERY: 
forget to take "question.img" column -> cannot find the images and undefined path or the folder store images
- $sql = 'SELECT question.id, question.text, question.date, user.name, question.img FROM question

Git:
Usually command used: 
step by step: 
- cd to the paricular folder: if not may be the whole folder COMP1841 with n files will be pushed all. 
- git init, git add .: add all files to that empty repo 
- git remote add origin -link repo-: if there is no repo and the repo link must have .git
- git remote set-url origin -link repo-: if want to change repo
- git remote -v: check the present repo 
- git commit
- git push -u origin main: push to main branch
